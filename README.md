Here is my latest data engineering project leveraging the power of Google Cloud and Mage!
I recently completed an end-to-end data engineering project using the Uber dataset, and I'm thrilled with the outcomes. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’¡

Here's a glimpse into the architecture I worked for this project:

ðŸ“Œ Data Ingestion: I started by uploading the Uber dataset to Google Cloud Storage, ensuring secure and reliable storage of the raw data.

ðŸ“Œ Data Transformation with Mage and Google Compute Engine: To perform the data transformation, I utilized Mage,Open-source data pipeline tool for transforming and integrating data. Mage's distributed processing capabilities allowed me to efficiently clean, transform, and enrich the dataset, ensuring its quality and integrity.

ðŸ“Œ Data Warehousing: The cleaned and transformed data was then loaded into Google BigQuery, a scalable and high-performance data warehousing solution, enabling fast and interactive analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Analytics and Insights: Leveraging the querying power of BigQuery and SQL, I conducted extensive analysis on the Uber dataset. I uncovered valuable insights related to user behavior, demand patterns, and performance metrics, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

ðŸ“Œ Visualization with Looker: To make the insights easily accessible and visually appealing, I used Looker, a robust data visualization and business intelligence platform. Looker allowed me to create interactive dashboards and visualizations, enabling stakeholders to gain intuitive and actionable insights.
